# Homestead Media — Full Site Reference

Last updated: July 2026  
Live site: https://dunnand.github.io/homestead_media/  
Local folder: C:\Users\Andy\homestead_media\

---

## 1. What This Site Is

A single-page web app (SPA) for the Homestead High School media program. Students and the teacher use it to manage:
- Radio broadcasting schedules (The Point 91FM, 2.0)
- Homestead Live TV show crew assignments and sign-ups
- HHS In-Depth TV show 5-week rundown planning
- Yearbook event coverage sign-ups
- IASB competition entry tracking
- Talk show planning wizard
- Lessons/training content

**Tech stack:** Vanilla JS + HTML + CSS, Firebase Firestore, GitHub Pages hosting.  
No build step — edit files, commit, push, and the site updates within ~2 minutes.

---

## 2. File Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | HTML shell — loads Firebase, data.js, script.js, styles.css |
| `script.js` | All app logic (~3,600 lines) — renders every page, handles all events |
| `data.js` | All constants and configuration — edit this for yearly updates |
| `styles.css` | All styling — dark theme, cards, tables, modals |
| `Code.gs` | Google Apps Script — keep a copy here; paste into script.google.com |
| `scripts/send-reminders.js` | Node.js email reminder script (not part of the main site) |
| `REFERENCE.md` | This file |

---

## 3. How to Deploy Changes

1. Edit files locally in `C:\Users\Andy\homestead_media\`
2. Open Git Bash or terminal in that folder:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "describe what you changed"
   git push
   ```
3. Wait ~2 minutes, then hard refresh the live site (Ctrl+Shift+R)

GitHub repo: https://github.com/dunnand/homestead_media

---

## 4. Firebase (Database)

**Project:** `audioaficionados-21ba0`  
**Console:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/audioaficionados-21ba0/firestore

Firebase config lives in `index.html`. The app uses the **Compat SDK** (v8/compat style).  
`getDB()` in script.js returns the Firestore instance (lazy-loaded singleton).

### Firestore Collections

| Collection | What It Stores |
|------------|---------------|
| `hm_broadcasts` | All Homestead Live events (football, basketball, etc.) with crew roles and checklists |
| `hm_availability` | Student sign-ups for broadcasts (name, email, role preferences) |
| `hm_radio` | Radio station schedules (doc: `station_schedule`) |
| `hm_iasb_entries` | IASB competition entries per category |
| `hm_radio_plans` | Talk show planning submissions from students |
| `hm_indepth_rundown` | TV show rundown data, keyed by week (YYYY-MM-DD of Monday) |
| `hm_indepth_beats` | Beat assignments (doc ID = beat number, fields: student1, student2, met — map of advisor-name keys the pair has checked off as met) |
| `hm_beat_info` | Beat overrides (doc ID = beat number, fields: name, covers, contacts) — set by teacher Edit Beat; students can also add/edit contacts inline (merge write on contacts only) |
| `hm_yearbook_coverage` | Yearbook event sign-ups (student, event, role) |
| `hm_yearbook_events` | Custom events added by teacher via dashboard |
| `hm_config` | App config: `show_schedule` (skipped Fridays), `cal_cache` (calendar event cache) |

---

## 5. Key Constants in data.js (Update Each Year)

### Sports / Game Schedules

```javascript
// Update each August with the new season schedule
const BASKETBALL_HOME_GAMES = [ ... ]       // Boys BB home games
const GIRLS_BASKETBALL_HOME_GAMES = [ ... ] // Girls BB home games
const FOOTBALL_HOME_GAMES = [ ... ]         // Football home games
const SPECIAL_EVENTS = [ ... ]              // Homecoming Dance, Prom, Show Choir, NHS, Graduation
```

**Entry format:**
```javascript
{ id: 'bb26-1121', title: 'Boys Basketball vs. Blackford', date: '2026-11-21',
  type: 'basketball_boys', gameTime: '7:30 PM', roles: {}, checks: {}, notes: 'Spartan Arena' }
```
- `id` must be unique — use format `typeYY-MMDD`
- `type` must match a key in `EVENT_TYPES` (football, basketball_boys, basketball_girls, etc.)
- `roles: {}` and `checks: {}` always start empty — Firestore fills them in at runtime

### IASB Settings

```javascript
const IASB_SEASON   = '2026-2027'     // Update each year
const IASB_DEADLINE = '2027-02-05'    // Update when IASB announces the date
const TEACHER_PIN   = '2027'          // Change to whatever you want
```

### Google Calendar & Apps Script

```javascript
const SYNC_SCRIPT_URL    = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwH9agFB6OR5nPBGKWB7h0_xRq8HR-kdHcd5lo2xZSX5s36qcoWbjZ3UVrr0i-xnzpC/exec'
const HHS_MEDIA_CAL_ID   = '2b9bdfdee65f7330d8d5d2fd1d4877c1b709289fa0b0747427f57fd62516bed5@group.calendar.google.com'
const GOOGLE_CAL_API_KEY  = 'AIzaSyCy5ZKtIjrF1lgDojmYgDlxit2Te7SKyeU'
```

- `SYNC_SCRIPT_URL` — Apps Script web app URL. Used to add/delete custom yearbook events on the Google Calendar. If this breaks, see Section 9 for how to re-deploy.
- `HHS_MEDIA_CAL_ID` — The HHS Media Events Google Calendar. Embedded as iframe in Yearbook and In-Depth pages.
- `GOOGLE_CAL_API_KEY` — Google Cloud API key for reading the public calendar. Restricted to `dunnand.github.io` and Calendar API only. Created in Google Cloud Console.

### Other External Links

```javascript
const IASB_DROPBOX_URL = 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Kg4UYcKzOLNYYqoEOG3fo2xbwNQtZCIY'
// 36 IASB_DRIVE_FOLDERS entries (R1-R9, N1-N8, S1-S9, V1-V9, M1-M9)
// DJ Panel: https://wcyt.org/dj  (Password: Homestead911-2.0)
// Walsworth: https://login.walsworthyearbooks.com/login
```

---

## 6. Pages / Views

The app has one HTML file. Navigation is via `go('viewname')` which sets `S.view` and re-renders.

| View | What It Shows |
|------|---------------|
| `home` | 5 class cards (Radio, Live, Sports, Yearbook, In-Depth) |
| `radio` | Station schedules, DJ panel link, Talk Show Planner, IASB hub link |
| `planner` | 6-step talk show planning form |
| `live` | Next broadcast countdown, crew roles, mini calendar sidebar |
| `broadcast` | Single broadcast: crew assignments, student sign-ups, checklist, notes |
| `schedule` | All broadcasts in date order |
| `availability` | Students sign up for broadcasts + choose role preferences |
| `sports` | Coming soon placeholder |
| `yearbook` | Event coverage sign-ups, calendar embed, shot list tips |
| `indepth` | 5-week TV rundown table + calendar |
| `beats` | 15 In-Depth coverage beats with student assignments |
| `iasb` | IASB competition hub with all 45 categories |
| `iasb-category` | Single IASB category: requirements, entries, checklist, drive link |
| `dashboard` | Teacher-only overview (PIN required) |
| `lessons` | Lesson hub → course → unit → lesson slides |

---

## 7. State Object (S)

All app state lives in one object in script.js. Resets on page reload — Firestore reloads data on `init()`.

```javascript
const S = {
  view: 'home',
  broadcastId: null,          // Which broadcast detail page is open
  teacherMode: false,         // Unlocked with PIN
  stationSchedule: {},        // { point: [...], two: [...] } from Firestore
  broadcasts: [],             // All Homestead Live events
  plannerStep: 0,             // Talk show planner progress (0-5)
  plannerData: null,          // Current planner form values
  submissions: [],            // Talk show plan submissions
  iasbEntries: [],            // All IASB entries from Firestore
  iasbCategory: null,         // Currently viewed IASB category code (e.g. 'R1')
  availabilities: [],         // Broadcast sign-ups
  lessonCourse: null,         // 'radio', 'indepth', etc.
  lessonUnit: null,
  lessonId: null,
  lessonSlide: 0,
  yearbookCoverage: [],       // Sign-ups from hm_yearbook_coverage
  customYbEvents: [],         // Teacher-added events from hm_yearbook_events
  calendarYbEvents: [],       // Events fetched via Google Calendar API
  ybDashView: 'event',        // Dashboard yearbook tab: 'event' | 'student' | 'role'
  expandedBeat: null,         // Which beat row is open
  beatAssignments: {},        // { beatId: { student1, student2 } }
  rundownData: {},            // { weekKey: { roleKey: value } }
  rundownWeekOffset: 0,       // Week nav: 0 = current, -1 = prev week, +1 = next
  showSchedule: [],           // Skipped Friday dates (YYYY-MM-DD[])
  calMonthOffset: 0,          // Homestead Live calendar month offset
  dashSections: {},           // { sectionId: true/false } — which sections are open
};
```

## 8. In-Depth Rundown

### Rundown Roles

```javascript
const RUNDOWN_ROLES = [
  { key: 'anchors',    label: 'Anchors',      pair: true,                         color: '#6366f1' },
  { key: 'packages',   label: 'Packages',     structured: true,                   color: '#f59e0b' },
  { key: 'vo_vosot',   label: 'VOs / VOSOTs', structured: true, typeToggle: true, color: '#a78bfa' },
  { key: 'commercial', label: 'Commercial',                                        color: '#f97316' },
  { key: 'psa',        label: 'PSA',                                               color: '#84cc16' },
  { key: 'weather',    label: 'Weather',                                           color: '#06b6d4' },
  { key: 'sports_btc', label: 'Sports / BTC',                                     color: '#22c55e' },
];
```

- `pair: true` → 2 name fields (Anchor 1 / Anchor 2)
- `structured: true` → rows of `{ type, topic, student }` with + Add button
- `typeToggle: true` → each row also has VO / VOSOT badge toggle
- Plain (no flags) → single text area

### How Week Keys Work
- Week key = Monday's date in YYYY-MM-DD
- Stored in `hm_indepth_rundown/{weekKey}/{roleKey}`
- Friday date is displayed in column headers but Monday is the Firestore key
- `getRundownWeeks()` returns 5 Mondays starting from current + offset

## 9. Google Apps Script (Code.gs)

### What It Does
- Copies varsity athletics events from the HHS source calendar to the HHS Media Events calendar
- Adds custom events to the calendar when teacher uses the Yearbook Event Manager
- Runs auto-sync every July 1

### How to Re-deploy (if the URL breaks)

1. Go to https://script.google.com
2. Create a new project (or open existing)
3. Paste the full contents of `Code.gs` (replace everything)
4. Click **Deploy → New deployment**
   - Type: Web app
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone**
5. Click **Deploy** — authorize when prompted (run `getUpcomingEvents` from editor first if needed)
6. Copy the new web app URL
7. Paste into `data.js` as `SYNC_SCRIPT_URL`
8. Run `createAnnualTrigger()` once from the editor (sets up auto-sync each July)
9. Commit and push data.js

### Important Deployment Settings
- **Execute as: Me** (not "User accessing the web app" — that forces login)
- **Who has access: Anyone** (not "Anyone with Google account" — that also forces login)

### Calendar IDs in Code.gs
```javascript
SOURCE_CAL_ID = 'fd9gn9o6bq5lfvsaiqkt4gs4n1gneqc6@import.calendar.google.com'
TARGET_CAL_ID = '2b9bdfdee65f7330d8d5d2fd1d4877c1b709289fa0b0747427f57fd62516bed5@group.calendar.google.com'
```

### Actions (called via JSONP from browser)
- `?action=sync` — Sync varsity events from source → target calendar
- `?action=addEvent&title=X&date=YYYY-MM-DD&time=X` — Add event to calendar
- `?action=deleteEvent&calEventId=X` — Delete event from calendar

> Note: Reading calendar events does NOT go through Apps Script anymore.  
> The site uses the Google Calendar API directly (see below).

## 10. Google Calendar API Key

**Key:** `AIzaSyCy5ZKtIjrF1lgDojmYgDlxit2Te7SKyeU`  
**Restrictions:** Websites → `https://dunnand.github.io/*` | API → Google Calendar API only  
**Cloud project:** "Singular" (project ID: singular-381913) at https://console.cloud.google.com

### If the Key Needs to Be Replaced
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com → select "Singular" project
2. APIs & Services → Credentials → + Create Credentials → API key
3. Restrict to: Websites → `https://dunnand.github.io/*`; API → Google Calendar API
4. Paste new key into `data.js` → `GOOGLE_CAL_API_KEY`
5. Commit and push

### How Calendar Events Get Into the Sign-Up Dropdown
1. `loadCalendarYbEvents()` runs on page load
2. Checks Firestore `hm_config/cal_cache` — if fresh (< 6 hours), uses that
3. Otherwise calls Google Calendar API with the key above
4. Maps event titles to types using `inferYbType()` (e.g., "volleyball" → `volleyball`)
5. Saves results to Firestore cache
6. Teacher can force refresh: Dashboard → Yearbook Event Manager → ↻ Refresh Calendar Events

---

## 11. Yearbook Sign-Up

### Event Sources (combined in `allYbEvents()`)
1. **Hardcoded** in `data.js` — football, basketball, girls BB, special events
2. **Teacher-added** via Dashboard → Yearbook Event Manager → + Add Event → `hm_yearbook_events`
3. **Google Calendar** — fetched via API, cached in `hm_config/cal_cache`

### Student Sign-Up Flow
1. Enter name + email (saved to localStorage for next visit)
2. Select Sport/Event Type from dropdown (only types with upcoming events appear)
3. Select specific event from second dropdown
4. Click Submit → saved to `hm_yearbook_coverage`

### Teacher Dashboard — Yearbook Event Manager
- **+ Add Event** → form with title, date, time, type → saves to Firestore + calendar
- **↻ Refresh Calendar Events** → clears cache, re-fetches all sports from Google Calendar
- **Coverage Sign-Ups** → view by Event, Student, or Role

---

## 12. Broadcast Timing Logic

| Sport | Arrival Location | Arrive Before Game | Door 33 Opens |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Basketball (boys/girls) | Media Row | 45 min | 75 min before tip |
| Football | Press Box | 60 min | 90 min before kickoff |
| All others | Crew Call | 60 min | 90 min before |

Functions: `computeArrival(gameTime, type)` and `computeDoor33(gameTime, type)` in script.js.

---

## 13. Teacher Dashboard Sections

Access: click 🔑 in nav → enter PIN (default: `2027`)

| Section | Firestore key | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| In-Depth Show Schedule | `hm_config/show_schedule` | Toggle Fridays as show/no-show for the year |
| IASB Entries | `hm_iasb_entries` | View/manage all competition entries by category |
| Talk Show Plans | `hm_radio_plans` | View all student talk show plan submissions |
| Athletics Calendar Sync | (runs Code.gs) | Manually trigger athletics calendar sync |
| Yearbook Event Manager | `hm_yearbook_events` | Add/delete custom events + refresh calendar cache |
| Yearbook Coverage Sign-Ups | `hm_yearbook_coverage` | View all sign-ups by event / student / role |

- Firebase Usage is **always visible** (not collapsible) — shows daily read/write counts
- All other sections start collapsed — click header to expand/collapse

---

## 14. IASB Competition

**45 categories** across 5 divisions: Radio (R1-R9), News (N1-N8), Sports (S1-S9), Video (V1-V9), Emerging Media (M1-M9)

Key settings to update each year:
```javascript
const IASB_SEASON   = '2027-2028'     // Update in data.js
const IASB_DEADLINE = '2028-02-05'    // Update in data.js
```

Drive submission folders are in `IASB_DRIVE_FOLDERS` in data.js (36 Google Drive links).  
Main dropbox: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Kg4UYcKzOLNYYqoEOG3fo2xbwNQtZCIY

---

## 15. Annual Start-of-Year Checklist

Do this each August before school starts:

- [ ] Update `BASKETBALL_HOME_GAMES` in data.js with new boys BB schedule
- [ ] Update `GIRLS_BASKETBALL_HOME_GAMES` in data.js with new girls BB schedule
- [ ] Update `FOOTBALL_HOME_GAMES` in data.js with new football schedule
- [ ] Update `SPECIAL_EVENTS` — confirm Homecoming Dance, Prom, Show Choir, NHS, Graduation dates
- [ ] Update `IASB_SEASON` and `IASB_DEADLINE`
- [ ] Change `TEACHER_PIN` if desired
- [ ] Commit and push all data.js changes
- [ ] In teacher dashboard → Athletics Calendar Sync → run sync to pull all other sports
- [ ] In teacher dashboard → Yearbook Event Manager → ↻ Refresh Calendar Events
- [ ] Review show schedule (all Fridays) and mark any that won't have a broadcast

---

## 16. School Year Date Logic

The app calculates the current school year with:
```javascript
const startYear = now.getMonth() >= 6 ? now.getFullYear() : now.getFullYear() - 1;
```
- July (month 6) or later → current year is the START of the upcoming school year
- e.g., July 2026 → school year 2026-2027 (startYear = 2026)

Show schedule spans: first Friday on or after Aug 21 → last Friday on or before May 28.

---

## 17. Common Code Patterns

### Adding a new view/page
1. Add a render function: `function renderMyPage() { return \`...\`; }`
2. Add a case in `render()`: `case 'mypage': app.innerHTML = renderMyPage(); break;`
3. Add event handlers in `attachListeners()`
4. Add nav link or `go('mypage')` call somewhere

### Saving to Firestore
```javascript
const db = getDB();
trackUsage('writes');
await db.collection('hm_mycollection').doc(id).set({ field: value });
```

### Reading from Firestore
```javascript
const db = getDB();
const snap = await db.collection('hm_mycollection').get();
trackUsage('reads', snap.size);
snap.docs.forEach(doc => { /* doc.id, doc.data() */ });
```

### Creating a modal
```javascript
const m = modal(`<h2>Title</h2><div class="form-group"><label>X</label><input id="my-input"></div>`, 'Delete', true);
m.querySelector('#modal-save').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const v = val('my-input');
  // ... save ...
  m.remove();
  render();
});
```

## 18. Known Notes & Quirks

- **No build step** — plain HTML/CSS/JS. Edit files and push.
- **Dark mode only** — CSS is written for dark theme; no light mode toggle.
- **No user authentication** — teacher access is PIN-only. Student names are self-reported.
- **Apps Script CORS** — The Apps Script URL cannot be called with `fetch()` from the browser (CORS block). The site uses JSONP for Apps Script calls (`fetchJsonp()` helper in script.js). Reading calendar events bypasses Apps Script entirely and uses the Google Calendar API directly.
- **GitHub Pages deploy time** — ~2 minutes after `git push`. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) after waiting.
- **Rundown week keys** — Stored as Monday's date (YYYY-MM-DD), not Friday's. Friday date is only for display.
- **Firestore cal_cache TTL** — 6 hours. If calendar events look stale in the yearbook dropdown, teacher hits ↻ Refresh in dashboard.
- **YEARBOOK_EVENTS de-duplication** — `allYbEvents()` de-dupes calendar events against hardcoded + custom events using `type|date` as the key.
- **inferYbType()** — Maps calendar event titles to type keys by checking for keywords (e.g., title includes "volleyball" → `volleyball`). If a sport isn't being categorized correctly, add a rule in this function in script.js.
